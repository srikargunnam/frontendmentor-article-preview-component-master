## My process 📜

### Built with 🏗

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS & Sass/Scss
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow 

### What I learned 📖

When i saw many websites where you click on share or some other similar option, some pop-up will appear and disppear when you click anywhere on the document, i never thought of how that used to happen, but with this project i implemented the similar feature, it worked well, but i don't know whether it is the right appraoch which i did or not.

### Continued development 💪

I observed a lot of improvement in my frontend desing approach, and i will keep it up and continue development of my overall approach. 

### Useful resources 📚	🗃

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/) - As usual, this will be a very usefull resource for every front end developer who works with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and evern for newbies who enter this field.
- [converting colors](https://convertingcolors.com) - this i used to convert some hsl formatted colors to hex, it might be useful even more than what i have used, will explore based on my neeeds.
